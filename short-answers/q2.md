# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer

Another way of achieving the same functionality with the `for` loop is by doing `if (!(i > 7)) ...` should function the same way as if you're using `break`.

# Teacher Feedback

You have the right idea! Your solution would definitely allow us to stop using the break statement however another solution would be to stop our for loop at 7.
